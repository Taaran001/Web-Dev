            <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
            <span class="span1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span>
            <span class="span2">(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
                civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the
                Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</span>
